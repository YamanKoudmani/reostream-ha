// Package cgi talks to a Reolink camera's HTTP API.
//
// Baichuan is the better transport and carries everything reostream needs for
// streaming, but a handful of camera settings have no Baichuan message id we
// have recovered: the fisheye view modes and the dual lens stitch parameters
// are both reachable only here for now. The message ids exist, since the
// official NVR sets both over Baichuan; finding them needs a capture of an
// NVR talking to a camera, or disassembly of the dispatch code, and neither
// is done. This package is what makes those features usable meanwhile.
